# Planning-and-Stock-Report-Generation-Agent

This project demonstrates how to set up and utilize multiple conversational AI agents to collaboratively generate a stock price performance blog post for Nvidia over the past month. The process involves defining various roles for the agents, setting up a group chat, and executing a task that includes planning, coding, executing code, and writing the blog post. The agents work together, with each fulfilling specific responsibilities, to complete the task efficiently.
